# Tourneey!
Tourneey is a Project for CS 326 at University of Massachusetts Amherst Created By Michael Xie.

Tourneey si designed to be a lightweight Tournament Creator, with future support to be added for multiple formats including Round Robin, Double Elimination, and Pools/Direct Elimination. The hope with this is to eventually deploy this so that others can also use this app. 

This app was created with Bootstrap , HTML, CSS, and Vanilla Javascript, with [Supabase](https://supabase.com/). Please Send help :D
